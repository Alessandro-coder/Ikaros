## IMPORTANT

TYPE CTRL + C TO SKIP A PROCESS LIKE THE BRUTE FORCE
FOR THE PASSWORD AND GO TO THE NEXT PROCESS.

DON'T WORRY!
IN THE NEXT UPDATE THERE WILL BE MANY BUG FIXES

## 1
The first option allows you to scan a certain host 
to find open ports on it;
Example 

ip: 192.1.1.0/24
port:443

Then it will show you only the ips with that port open.

Or you could do a normal scan for all the port just
typing Enter when it will ask you for the port.

Or even better you could scan the entire web for an 
open port

ip:0.0.0.0/0
port:443

## RESULTS

THE RESULTS OF THE SCAN WILL BE PUT IN THE FOLDER 
OF IKAROS ON YOUR DESKTOP.

## 2
The second option will be added soon in the next update.

## 3
The third option allows you to make a full-scan with many
tools and a pentest on the host.

## RESULTS

THE RESULTS OF THE SCAN WILL BE PUT IN THE FOLDER 
OF IKAROS ON YOUR DESKTOP.
